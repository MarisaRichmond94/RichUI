<hr />

<b>Richmond UI</b> contains foundational React UI components for shipping new features faster (much like other popular libraries like Material UI or Bootstrap, except styled the way I want them for my applications).

## Installation

```
// with npm
npm i richmond-ui

// with yarn
yarn add richmond-ui
```

**Note**: Richmond UI is still a work in progress. I am adding new components as they are needed for various projects. You are NOT welcome to contribute. Why? Because I'm a snob. The only reason this package isn't private is because I'm too cheap to pay for a private repo.

## Getting Started With Richmond UI

Here is an example of a basic app using Richmond UI's `RichButton` component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { RichButton } from 'richmond-ui';

function App() {
    return (
        <RichButton transparent outline>
            Submit
        </RichButton>
    );
};
```

## Examples

To see examples of what types of components are available and how you can configure them, just take a look at the Storybook link I will totally include in this section... eventually.
